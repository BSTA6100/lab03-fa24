There are no widely accepted criteria for distinguishing between patients who should be admitted to an ICU and those for whom admission to other hospital units would be more appropriate. Thus, among different ICUs, there are wide ranges in a patient's chance of survival. When studies are done to compare effectiveness of ICU care, it is critical to have a reliable means of assessing the comparability of the different patient populations.\n\nOne such strategy for doing so involves the use of statistical modeling to relate empirical data for many patient variables to outcomes of interest. The following dataset consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult ICU.[^1] The major goal of the study was to develop a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival to hospital discharge.[^2]\n\n[^1]: From Hosmer D.W., Lemeshow, S., and Sturdivant, R.X. *Applied Logistic Regression*. 3^rd^ ed., 2013.\n\n[^2]: Lemeshow S., et al. Predicting the outcome of intensive care unit patients. *Journal of the American Statistical Association* 83.402 (1988): 348-356.\n\nThe following table provides a list of some the variables in the dataset and their description. The data are accessible as the `icu` dataset in the `aplore3` package.\n\n| Variable | Description                                           |\n|---------:|:------------------------------------------------------|\n|     `id` | patient ID number                                     |\n|    `sta` | patient status at discharge, either `Lived` or `Died` |\n|    `age` | patient age in years at admission                     |\n| `gender` | patient gender, etiher `Male` or `Female`             |\n|    `cpr` | CPR prior to admission, either `No` or `Yes`          |\n|    `hra` | Heart rate at admission (beats per minute)            |\n|    `sys` | Systolic blood pressure at admission (mm Hg)          |\n\nWe'll first load and inspect the data.

Creatinine level in the data are recorded as being either less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or greater than 2.0 mg/dL. A typical creatinine level is between 0.5 - 1.0 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine may be a sign of renal failure.\n\n::: question\na.

An important *diagnostic* for a linear regression model is a plot of residuals vs. the fitted values (i.e., the $\\hat{Y}$'s). This helps us check\n\n1.  the assumption that the residuals have mean zero, which tells us that the model is correctly specified, and\n2.  the assumption that the residuals have a constant variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\nTo access the residuals of a model object, use `$residuals`. So if your model is stored as `mod1`, for example, you can get the residuals with `mod1$residuals`. Similarly for fitted values: `mod1$fitted.values`.\n\nCreate a plot of the residuals vs. fitted values for the model you fit in Question 7, and discuss what you see. You don't need to think about how the assumptions come into play, just describe the scatterplot.\n:::\n\n::: answer\n```{r}\n#| label: question8\n#| error: true\n\n# Replace this comment with code required for Question 8.
