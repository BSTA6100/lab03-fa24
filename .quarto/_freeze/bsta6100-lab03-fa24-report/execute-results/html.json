It is important that you keep your answers inside the \".answer\" blocks. Do NOT delete the three colon blocks (:::) and keep your responses between them. Use the tutorial for help, and don't be afraid to ask questions.\n\n**Collaborators:** If applicable, replace this text with the names of anyone you collaborated with on this project.\n\nYou can find a list of colors you can use in R [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). You can also directly use RGB colors via the `rgb()` function (see the help for more), or hex codes. If you don't know what those are, stick to the named colors in the linked PDF.\n\nThe material in this lab is adapted from *OpenIntro Biostatistics*.\n\n## Background\n\nPatients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) are either extremely ill or considered to be at great risk of serious complications. There are no widely accepted criteria for distinguishing between patients who should be admitted to an ICU and those for whom admission to other hospital units would be more appropriate. Thus, among different ICUs, there are wide ranges in a patient's chance of survival. When studies are done to compare effectiveness of ICU care, it is critical to have a reliable means of assessing the comparability of the different patient populations.\n\nOne such strategy for doing so involves the use of statistical modeling to relate empirical data for many patient variables to outcomes of interest. The following dataset consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult ICU.[^1] The major goal of the study was to develop a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival to hospital discharge.[^2]\n\n[^1]: From Hosmer D.W., Lemeshow, S., and Sturdivant, R.X. *Applied Logistic Regression*. 3^rd^ ed., 2013.\n\n[^2]: Lemeshow S., et al. Predicting the outcome of intensive care unit patients. *Journal of the American Statistical Association* 83.402 (1988): 348-356.\n\nThe following table provides a list of some the variables in the dataset and their description. The data are accessible as the `icu` dataset in the `aplore3` package.\n\n| Variable | Description                                                               |\n|--------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------|\n|     `id` | patient ID number                                                         |\n|    `sta` | patient status at discharge, either `Lived` or `Died`                     |\n|    `age` | patient age in years at admission                                         |\n| `gender` | patient gender, etiher `Male` or `Female`                                 |\n|    `cpr` | CPR prior to admission, either `No` or `Yes`                              |\n|    `hra` | Heart rate at admission (beats per minute)                                |\n|    `sys` | Systolic blood pressure at admission (mm Hg)                              |\n|    `cre` | Creatinine from initial blood gases, either `<= 2.0` or `> 2.0`, in mg/dL |\n\nWe'll first load and inspect the data.
